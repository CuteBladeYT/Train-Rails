### I can bet you didn't played any game like this.

##### This game shows that even text-based ones can be good as well.


I was inspired by [DDEX](https://ddlc-modding.fandom.com/wiki/Doki_Doki_Exit_Music). I wanted to create my own game based on [interactive novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_novel). My graphical skills aren't too good, so I couldn't create any images for the game, so the decission is that the game will be text-based. Just a story with the player decissions, multiple endings and much more!

**BUT** if you are bored on the default storyline, you can download stories created by other users, or even create your own! See full documentation on this Github.
